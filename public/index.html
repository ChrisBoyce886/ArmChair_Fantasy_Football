      <ul class="list-unstyled text-left">
      <li>In this game you go head to head with another user with the goal of creating your own fantasy NFL team with the best players of your choice. </li>
      <br>  
      <li> Each NFL player is assigned a fantasy position ranking based on the average 2019 projected fantasy rankings from multiple 
        online sources such as ESPN, CBS Sports, Yahoo Sports, etc. </li>
      <br>
      <li> It is your job to predict their fantasy values for the 2019 season using your knowledge of recent football drafts, trades, 
        and the 2018 stats which will be made available for you. </li>   
      <br>
      <li> You will have one minute per round to select [in order] your Quarterback, Runningback, 2 Wide Receivers, Tightend, Kicker, and a Team Defense.</li> 
      <br>
      <li> You will not see your opponents picks until the game is over; It is possible for both players to pick the same players.</li>
      <br>
      <li> When all picks have been made, your rosters will be compared and the player whose picks average the highest overall rankings of players will be crowned the Winner!</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Good Luck Coach!
